## Sequence search
The Sequence search tool extracts CDS, Transcript, Protein or Genomic sequences from the CMS database.

Simply type in gene ids in the large text box and select the desired type of sequence from the dropdown lit. Then click the Submit button. Now you can use the Download button to download the sequence or the phylogeny tree button to create a phylogenic tree using phylogeny.fr. By default, the sequence search tool shows the genes from the active GeneList.

**Implementation**
The Sequence search tool was developed using JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and fastacmd.
